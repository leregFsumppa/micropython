XForce Keygen is a software that can generate serial keys and activation codes for various Autodesk products, including Sketchbook. It is a simple and easy way to bypass the official registration process and enjoy the full features of Sketchbook without paying anything. However, using XForce Keygen is illegal and may expose you to security risks. Therefore, we do not recommend or endorse this method of activation.
 
If you still want to try it at your own risk, here are the steps you need to follow:
 
1. Download Sketchbook from the official website or from the Autodesk community of students and educators. You can choose a free trial or a student version.
2. Download XForce Keygen 2021 from a reliable source. Make sure you have an antivirus program installed and scan the file before opening it.
3. Run the setup file of Sketchbook and enter one of these serial numbers: 666-69696969, 667-98989898, 400-45454545.
4. Use the product key 871M1 for Sketchbook.
5. Click next and wait for the installation to finish.
6. Open Sketchbook and click on Activate. If it says that the serial number is incorrect, close the window and click on Activate again.
7. Select "I have an activation code from Autodesk" and copy the request code that appears.
8. Run XForce Keygen as administrator (right-click on xforce - run as administrator) either 32-bit or 64-bit (depending on your computer).
9. Click on "Memory Patch" (if successful, it will say "successfully patched").
10. Paste the request code that you copied in step 7 into the keygen and click on "Generate". Copy the activation code that is generated.
11. Go back to the activation window of Sketchbook and paste the activation code that you copied in step 10. Click next.
12. Congratulations! You have activated Sketchbook with XForce Keygen.
