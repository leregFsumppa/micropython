In this article, we will show you some of the most common and effective methods that have worked for many users.

## Solution 1: Disable and Re-enable the Hamachi Connection
 
One of the simplest and easiest methods to fix the Hamachi relayed tunnel issue is to disable and re-enable the Hamachi connection in your network settings. This can refresh your connection and resolve any minor glitches that may be causing the problem. Here is how to do it:
 
1. Press Windows + R keys on your keyboard to open the Run dialog box. Type `ncpa.cpl` and click OK to open the Network Connections window.
2. Alternatively, you can also open the Control Panel, switch the View by setting to Category, click on Network and Internet, and then click on Network and Sharing Center. From there, click on Change adapter settings on the left menu.
3. In the Network Connections window, right-click on the Hamachi network connection and select Disable from the context menu that appears.
4. Wait for a few minutes and then right-click on the Hamachi network connection again and select Enable from the context menu.
5. Check if the Hamachi relayed tunnel issue is fixed. If not, try the next solution.

## Solution 2: Restart the LogMeIn Hamachi Tunneling Engine Service
 
Another possible cause of the Hamachi relayed tunnel issue is that the LogMeIn Hamachi Tunneling Engine service, which is responsible for creating and managing VPN connections, is not working properly. To fix this, you can try restarting the service and see if that helps. Here is how to do it:

1. Press Windows + R keys on your keyboard to open the Run dialog box. Type `services.msc` and click OK to open the Services window.
2. In the Services window, scroll down and locate the LogMeIn Hamachi Tunneling Engine service. Right-click on it and select Restart from the context menu that appears.
3. If you see a message saying that some other services will also be restarted, click OK to confirm.

## Solution 3: Use Static UDP and TCP Ports and Configure Port Forwarding
 
A more advanced method to fix the Hamachi relayed tunnel issue is to use static UDP and TCP ports for Hamachi and configure port forwarding on your router. This can ensure that your router allows incoming and outgoing traffic for Hamachi and creates a direct connection between you and your friend. Here is how to do it:

1. Open Hamachi and click on System > Preferences > Settings.
2. In the Settings window, go to the Advanced tab and check the boxes next to Use static UDP port for peer connections and Use static TCP port for peer handshake.
3. Note down the port numbers that are displayed next to these options. By default, they should be 17771 for UDP and 32976 for TCP.
4. Click OK to save your changes and close Hamachi.
