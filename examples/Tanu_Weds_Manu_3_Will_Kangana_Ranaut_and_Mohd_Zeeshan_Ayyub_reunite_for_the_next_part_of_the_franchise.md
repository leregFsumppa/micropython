Ever since then, fans have been eagerly waiting for the third instalment of the franchise, but there has been no official announcement from the makers yet. However, a recent interview of actor Mohd Zeeshan Ayyub, who played a pivotal role in both the films, has sparked some curiosity among the fans.
  
Ayyub, who played Chintu aka advocate Arun Kumar Singh in Tanu Weds Manu Returns, revealed that writer Himanshu Sharma had told him that he was planning to focus on Tanu and Chintu's characters in Tanu Weds Manu 3. Chintu was a friend of Tanu who had a crush on her and tried to woo her despite knowing that she was married to Manu.
  
Ayyub said that Sharma had been joking about this idea for a long time, but he had not really started working on the script yet. He also said that he did not know if director Aanand L Rai and actors Kangana Ranaut and R Madhavan were on board for the project.
  
If this idea materializes, it would be interesting to see how Tanu and Chintu's relationship evolves in the third film. Will they end up together or will they face more complications? Will Manu and Raja (played by Jimmy Sheirgill), who were also in love with Tanu, come back into the picture? Will Kangana play another double role or a new character?
  
These are some of the questions that fans would love to get answers to. However, until then, they can enjoy watching the first two films of Tanu Weds Manu on various streaming platforms.
  
However, there is no official confirmation about the release date of Tanu Weds Manu 3 yet. The makers have not made any announcement regarding the cast, crew, or plot of the film. Fans are eagerly waiting for some clarity on the status of the project, which has been in the pipeline for a long time.
  
Meanwhile, both Kangana Ranaut and R Madhavan have been busy with their respective projects. Kangana has a slew of films lined up for release, including Dhaakad, Tejas, Manikarnika Returns: The Legend of Didda, and Emergency. She is also set to make her digital debut as a producer with Tiku Weds Sheru, starring Nawazuddin Siddiqui and Avneet Kaur.
  
R Madhavan, on the other hand, has been working on his directorial debut Rocketry: The Nambi Effect, based on the life of former ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan. He is also part of the upcoming web series Decoupled, opposite Surveen Chawla.
  
Tanu Weds Manu and Tanu Weds Manu Returns were both directed by Aanand L Rai and written by Himanshu Sharma. The films also featured Jimmy Sheirgill, Deepak Dobriyal, Swara Bhasker, Eijaz Khan, and Rajesh Sharma in supporting roles. The films were praised for their humour, music, and performances.
